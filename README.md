# Adaptive-Resource-Allocation-in-Multiprogramming-Systems

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Adaptive Resource Allocation in a Multiprogramming Environment**.  
The main goal is to efficiently allocate CPU and memory resources among multiple running processes to improve system performance, reduce resource wastage, and prevent starvation.

The system dynamically monitors system load and adapts resource distribution based on process requirements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand multiprogramming and resource management concepts
- To design an adaptive resource allocation strategy
- To monitor CPU and memory usage dynamically
- To improve system efficiency and fairness among processes
- To simulate real-time decision-making in operating systems

## 🧠 Problem Statement
In multiprogramming systems, static resource allocation can lead to poor performance, underutilization, or starvation.  
This project addresses the need for a **dynamic and adaptive resource allocation mechanism** that adjusts resource distribution based on current system conditions.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Analyze running processes and their resource requirements  
2. Monitor CPU and memory utilization  
3. Apply adaptive logic to reallocate resources dynamically  
4. Display system status using a dashboard interface  
5. Evaluate system performance after reallocation
