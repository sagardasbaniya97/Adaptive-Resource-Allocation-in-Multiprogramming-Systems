**Adaptive Resource Allocation in Multiprogramming Systems (ARA)**
A real-time web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing system resources with adaptive process priority management.

🎯** Project Overview**
This project implements an Adaptive Resource Allocation system designed for multiprogramming environments. It monitors CPU and memory usage in real-time and dynamically adjusts process priorities based on configurable thresholds.
**
✨ Features**
Real-time Resource Monitoring: Live CPU and memory usage tracking with visual indicators
Process Management: View and manage running processes with priority adjustment
Adaptive Priority Engine: Automatically adjusts process priorities based on resource thresholds
Interactive Charts: Visualize resource usage trends over time
Activity Logs: Track all system actions and priority changes
Configurable Thresholds: Set custom CPU and memory thresholds for priority decisions
CSV Export: Export process data for external analysis
🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
Charts: Recharts for data visualization
UI Components: Radix UI + shadcn/ui
Build Tool: Vite
State Management: React Hooks
📊 Dashboard Components
Component	Description
System Metrics	Displays CPU, Memory, Cores, and Uptime
Resource Chart	Real-time line chart of resource usage
Process Table	List of active processes with controls
Activity Logs	System event history
Threshold Config	Adjustable priority thresholds
🚀 Getting Started
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
⚙️ How It Works
Monitoring: The system continuously monitors CPU and memory usage
Threshold Check: When usage exceeds configured thresholds, the decision engine activates
Priority Adjustment: Processes are automatically reprioritized to optimize resource allocation
Logging: All actions are logged for audit and analysis
